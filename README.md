✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-monorepo-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

[Click here to finish setting up your workspace!](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/S7OsMzCYER)

## To use library with shadcn/ui
Follow instruction to install shadcn/ui
```html
https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite
```

Confirm `package.json` has the following dependencies
```html
"dependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.0.16",
    "@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.0.16",
...
},
"devDependencies": {
...
  "postcss": "8.4.38",
  "prettier": "^3.5.3",
  "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss": "^0.6.11",
  "tailwindcss": "^4.0.5",
  "tailwind-merge": "^3.0.2",
  "tailwindcss-animate": "^1.0.7",
...
}
```

Inside `postcss.config.js`, change the content into this
```html
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/postcss'),
  ]
};
```

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve kp-portfolio-web
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build kp-portfolio-web
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project kp-portfolio-web
```

To generate new component, run:
```sh
nx g @nx/react:component src/app/components/home/home --style=css
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:app kp-karport-win --directory=apps/kp-karport-win
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
